         <h2>I. Found. Opportunity.</h2>
        
        
        <p> Born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida meant home cooked meals and awaiting laughter at every corner. Jacksonville was home but as time when on, I realized it was time for more. After high school, I realized going off to school, even if itâ€™s only an hour and forty-five minutes away, was the only way to grown beyond my current state. I developed a hunger to go! Go, meet new people, visit new places, make new friends, and experience the unknown. I had a hunger for growth.</p>
        
        <p> Who knew coming to the<a href="http://www.ufl.edu"> University of Florida</a> would be that perfect opportunity I was looking for; at the time, I had no clue. Upon my arrival, I jump right in with the Florida Opportunity Scholarship program. This program allowed me to build upon a solid foundation for the duration of my college career and beyond. I learned how to budget and manage my time between classes and work. I was fortunate to find great mentorship and develop leadership skills. Also, I was able to attend seminars and hear awesome speakers that inspired me to give my all and build true work ethic.
