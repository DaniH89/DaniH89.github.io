         The saying is true; it really is great to be a Florida Gator! Greetings, and special Thanks to you for visiting my site!

      <p>
        As a graduating senior from the <a href=http://www.ufl.edu>University of Florida</a>, I have decided to take the skills I have gained over the years and present them as an online portfolio. 
        </p>
         
         <p>
             During my time at UF, I was able to take advantage of endless resources through leadership and mentorship programs. I was able to experience the fullness of winning both championship games as well as build lasting relationships with my classmates. Honestly, there is no better school than The University of Florida.</p>
