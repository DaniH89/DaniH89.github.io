           After encountering the reality of Modern Day Slavery, known today as Human Trafficking, and exhausting all other ways to help, blogging became a suitable solution when all previous efforts failed. Being a college student, money was not with reach to fund relief for the broken little boys and girls that fall victim to this horrid reality. Instead, I chose awareness. <a href="http://http://hdan89.wordpress.com/">My Blog</a> is called Human Traffricking our Moder Day Slavery and its purpose is to serve the voiceless. The child that crys out for justice in a world that's so busy to stop and listen.
