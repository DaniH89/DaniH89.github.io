           After encountering the reality of Modern Day Slavery, known today as Human Trafficking, and exhausting all other ways to help, blogging became a suitable solution when all previous efforts failed. Being a college student, money was not within reach. Instead, I chose awareness. <a href="http://http://hdan89.wordpress.com/">My Blog</a> is called Human Traffricking our Moder Day Slavery and its purpose is to serve the voiceless. The child that crys out for justice in a world that's so busy to stop and listen.

        <h3>A. Call. To. Action.</h3>
        <h4>Find an organization in your area and get involved today!</h4>

        If you’re a graduating college student like me, then you probably aren't making $100,000 right out school.  For me, money isn’t readily available and because of this known fact, I would find myself at a crossroad. Having a desire to help and funds being at an all time low was not ideal. Then I had an epiphany; I can get involved with an organization and help that way.  Now I know you’re probably thinking “Duh, get involved,” but for me with a need this big, I saw giving as the best way to help stop this repulsive pandemic. However, spreading awareness and getting educated was the best place to start. From there, I researched organizations and found one that was perfect on for me and got involved.
